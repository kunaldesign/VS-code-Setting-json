# RapidAPI Client for Visual Studio Code

RapidAPI Client is a full-featured HTTP client that lets you test and describes the APIs you build or consume. Designed to work with your VS Code themes, RapidAPI Client makes composing requests, inspecting server responses, generating client code for API calls, and typesafe objects for application development simple and intuitive. Our client provides a great alternative to: Postman, Rest Client, and other HTTP clients.

## Why RapidAPI Client for Visual Studio Code?

The RapidAPI Client for VS Code brings API testing to your favorite code editor, so you can test APIs no matter where you are in the development cycle. You can compose requests, inspect server responses, generate client code, and export API definitions from our interface without ever switching context to another application. Beyond being a fantastic stand-alone client in VS Code, this extension establishes a bidirectional link between VS Code and RapidAPI so that users with an existing RapidAPI.com or Paw user account can log in and sync existing projects automatically.

## Features

#### TIP: Use the create from clipboard command

Got a URL in your clipboard or a cURL command? Then you can use the RapidAPI: Create new request from clipboard command to create the request for you automatically.

If you use a cURL command, the method, headers, and body will automatically be populated.

### Terminal link handler

When building or using tools which return API URLs in the terminal? Great, we have you covered with our optional terminal link handling. Our terminal link handler lets you generate new requests from the links logged in the console. As this overrides the default VS Code behavior, you must enable it with the `rapidapi.terminalLink.enabled` setting.

> **Important**: This feature requires you to set the `rapidapi.terminalLink.enabled` setting to `true` in your VS Code user or global settings.
